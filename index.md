## CLI Installation

As of now, our most mature client is the NodeJS one, which you can easily install from NPM:

npm install -g tldr

## Contribute

Fork project's [Github repo]({{ site.github }}).

This repository is just that: an ever-growing collection of examples for the most common UNIX / Linux / OSX / SunOS / Windows commands.

You're encouraged to edit some page from the `pages/` folder and submit a pull request. Just keep in mind the few things below.

#### Best Practices:

- Have a look at a few existing pages.
- Focus on the 5-6 most common usages.
- When in doubt, keep new command-line users in mind.
- Introduce examples gradually, from simple to complex.
- Don't explain general UNIX concepts.
